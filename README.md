# FEC Course Material

This github repository provides access to additional material for the short course [SC514 FEC Techniques for Optical Communcations](https://www.ofcconference.org/en-us/home/program-speakers/short-courses/sc514/) at the [OFC Conference](https://www.ofcconference.org) in 2024, 2025.

* [Part X](./SC514-FEC%20Techniques%20for%20Optical%20Communications%20-%20Part%20X.pdf) This part was newly added for the 2025 course. It is made available here electronically, and not yet part of the printed handout.

* [Jupyter notebooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/115nb52heSU_xaC_xDuzp0W4-rpZM3X7w?usp=sharing) for generating the plots in the course notes.

  For opening the notebooks, you have two options:
  1. If you have a google account, sign in, click on the vertical three dots ("More action") in the rightmost column of the google drive page and choose "Open with -> Google Colaboratory".
  2. You can download the notebook to your computer. You can then open the notebook locally, given that you have the required python packages including jupyter notebook installed.
